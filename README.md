# UAlberta Course Prerequisites Finder
[UAlberta Course Prerequisites Finder](https://www.uaprereqs.ca/) (UaPrereqs for short) provides an easy way for students to find and visualize the right prerequisites they need for any course. The program displays the inputted course and all their prerequisites in a neat, interactive flowchart for ease of visualization of what the user needs to take.


# Usage

UaPrereqs was designed with simplicity in mind, to use it:

 1. Type in the desired course name, along with the number. Eg, "MATH 101".
 2. Hit enter or click "Submit"

After searching for the course and it's prerequisites, a flowchart will be displayed for the user.
